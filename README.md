May the force be with you #LOL


## Requirements

These are a couple of the main requirements for this school project:

1. Create a directory on github called **“runtrack3”**. In this directory, create a **“jour01”** directory, 
share it with **deepthoughtlaplateforme**. For each job, create a **“jobXX”** folder where XX is the job number. 
Don’t forget to send your changes as soon as a job is advanced or completed and include explicit comments in your commits.
